<h1> PIKE PLACE PLEASURES </h1>

<br><br><br>
  
 
<p> My most favorite interest has to be one of the greatest Seattle gems which is Pike Place Market. I brought this extraganza to your eyes today so that you remember to visit Seattle's Pike Place Market the next time you are in the City Of The Rain. My most memorable times to go are during the holiday season. This is one of my favorite places in the world! The delicious food, the wonderful sights, the very bright lights, and the people are marvelous! The scene is absolutely ecstatic. The best part about what we love to call the Emerald City is the fact that you can come downtown to Pikes Place and get lost in a fantasy during the holidays. A traditional display can be seen below! I love how anyone no matter who they are or where they come from, can enjoy themselves exuberantly at the Pike Place Market.</p>

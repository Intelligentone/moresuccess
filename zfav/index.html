<h1> Special Interest </h1>

<br><br><br>
  
 
<h1> One of my favorite personal interest has to be one of the greatest Seattle gems which is Pike Place Market. I brought this extraganza to your eyes today so that you remember to visit Seattle's Pike Place Market the next time you are in the City Of The Rain. My most memorable times to go are during the holiday season. I exuberantly recommend the delicious food, the wonderful sights, the very bright but beautiful lights, and the people are marvelous! The experience is absolutely ecstatic. The best part about what we love to call the Emerald City is the fact that you can come downtown to Pikes Place and get entranced into a fantasy during the holidays or anyday that suits you best. A traditional display can be seen below! I love how anyone no matter who they are or where they come from, can enjoy themselves amazingly at the Pike Place Market.</h1>

  This website that was develeoped to become a profile is by Akiel Joseph-Taylor. It shows various projects that I have successfully completed. These projects mean an enormous amount to me because they reflect the first few projects that I have ever created when pertaining to the Software field. You will see the progression in my work as well as the effort in my results. Please read more about the creator of this website in the About section. I hope that you enjoy the journey that was created by an aspiring Software Developer such as myself and my first creation of a website. 
  
  What you will find here is a creative mind, focused on completing the first basic lessons in the interesting field of technolgy. I put a tremendous amount of hardwork into making a website for you, so that you could see how my skills have progressed throughout the terrific quarter. This website started in February of 2023. At this time, I have taken only a few Software classes so this hands on experience has been very positive and significant towards my understanding of the subject. I created the website so that I could become more knowledgeable of developing software. What was most important to me after the completion of this website was not only the success of the completion but also the confidence to know that I can now continue to advance from where I am now because of the wisdom that I earned. My creation of this website was to build my skills to perfection. I hope that you see the progress.

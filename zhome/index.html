Welcome to my website! This site is a profile developed by Akiel Joseph-Taylor. It shows many different projects that I worked on. These projects mean a colossal amount to me because they reflect the first few projects that I ever made when pertaining to the Software field. Please read more about the creator of this website in the About section. I hope that you enjoy the journey that was created by an aspiring Software Developer and his very first creation of a website. 

What you will find here is hard work and effort put into making a website for you to be able to see how my skills have progressed throughout the terrific quarter.This website was created in early 2023. At this time I have taken only a few Software classes so the hands on experience was very positive and significant towards my learning the subject. I created the website to prove to myself that I can do it. Not just that I can finish the assignment but that I could understand and succeed in the basics of creating technology.

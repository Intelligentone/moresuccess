  This website that was develeoped to become a profile is by Akiel Joseph-Taylor. It shows various projects that I have successfully completed. These projects mean an enormous amount to me because they reflect the first few projects that I have ever created when pertaining to the Software field. You will see the progression in the work as well as the effort in the results. Please read more about the creator of this website in the About section. I hope that you enjoy this website that was created by an aspiring Software Developer for the very first time.
  
  What you will find here is a creative mind, focused on completing the first basic lessons in the incredible field of technolgy. A tremendous amount of hardwork was put into making a website for you to enjoy and for me to advance. This website started in February of 2023. At the time of this development, Mr. Joseph Taylor has taken only a few Software classes so this hands on experience has been very positive and significant towards the understanding of the field. This website was also created so that Mr. Joseph Taylor could become more knowledgeable within the development of software. What's important to Mr. Joseph Taylor is the completion of this website. The expertise to aggrandize towards Mr. Joseph Taylors accomplishments was also vital in the decision for this site to be created.

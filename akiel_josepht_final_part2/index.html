<h2>* What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>

<br>

  I previously had no known knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. This is one of my first courses in Software Development. Throughout this positive learning experience, I have learned an enormous amount of all three of the coding languages since the very start of the class. Before this course, I knew of just a few other coding languages but not any of these three at the time.


<br><br><br>


<h2>* Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h2>
<br>

  The very first portfolio I used was from one of the other template examples that was provided to me for my own personalized utilization but that specific template did not work out to be one that I partially wanted to work with at the time. I decided to start a new website with a new template and chose for that one to become live. I started my portfolio from the second template but then I altered and narrowed some of the code down to my own personalized preference. For this being my first creation of a website, I believed this to be most effective. 


<br><br><br>




<h2>* What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h2>


<br>

  The biggest challenge for me became to make sure that there was viewable consistency throughout all of the pages. For example, when I had to change the clock code for the live clock time, I had to make sure I changed the code on all of the other HTML and the JavaScript pages as well. That was also the most time consuming aspect of building the website. I had to also spend a decent amount of time on checking the code for all of the pages. It was a very good experience when learning how everything works, overall.

<h2>* How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?Â </h2>
<br>

  Taking this class changed my view by causing me to be more intrigued not only in the Web Development field but also in the Software development field in general, as well. This Prog 109 class encouraged my increased interest in building websites in my future. It has provided me with more insight on what it takes to develop these coding languages and has also shown me ways to become successful in coding. One of my goals now is to build websites and apps professionally one day, so this class was excellent when pertaining to having the oppurtunity to have hands on experience.

<br><br><br>



<h2>* What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
<br>

  To students taking this class in the future, I would recommend reading all the chapters at least twice and to take notes on the example code provided inside of the book, especially! If you do not want to reread every chapter then please be prepared to at the least, reread a few of the chapters.Thoroughly. This is my recommendation because a student can save a considerable amount of time coding and debugging by rereading the material that is provided from the lessons in the book. Taking great notes throughout the course always plays a positive role to the coursework. This is especially true in this course, so it is vital that a student conducts effective studying as well.

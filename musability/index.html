1st Recommendation from SiteImprove
AAA 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)
<br><br>
  There are 218 occurrences of contrast (enhanced) 1.4.6 on the website Espn.com. This means that there are 218 occurrences where the color contrast in insufficient. Insufficient contrast between text and background can give issues to users with visual impairments. It could also lead to vital text being overlooked.<br> 
1.  I recommend that the developer of the site debug the website and make for certain that the text and color of the background are sufficiently contrasted to each other.
<br>
  2. I also recommend that the site be upgraded so that the contrast ratio is sufficient. For example, The contrast ratio should be at 7:1 for normal text and 4:5:1 for larger text.

2nd Recommendation from SiteImprove
AAA: 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only)
<br><br>There are 11 occurrences of linked text used for multiple different destinations. This means that the same link text is used for links going to different destinations. Users may not know exactly where they are going if it’s not somehow explained.<br>
1. I recommend that the site be enhanced so that the links can be distinguished by their link text or some other way for the user to be notified. For example, providing link text that describes the purpose of the link would help tremendously.
<br>
2. I also recommend that the site developers use a technique from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2, which is to possibly supplement link text with title attributes. That would make it more accessible for all users.

  3rd Recommendation from SiteImprove
AAA: 2.4.10 Section Headings 
<br><br>
    There are 10 occurrences of Headings missing their text which means that there is no text in the tag where there should be. Users can become slightly confused by this while attempting to read and surf the site.<br>
1. I recommend that the site be improved by double checking all headings h1 through h6 while developing the site to make for certain that their is text filling these areas so it doesn’t cause confusion for the users while utilizing the site.
<br>
    2. I also recommend changing the structures of some of the pages with the errors shown so that instead of empty headings, regular text or some other form of valuable bit of information can replace the empty spaces. For example, maybe a picture or icon that  relates to other information to the passage.
